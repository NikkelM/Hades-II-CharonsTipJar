## v1.4.2

<!--Releasenotes start-->
- If participating in a Chaos trial, the tip jar will now always appear in the final room before the boss, even if it contains a free reward and not a shop.
- Prevented voicelines from playing where Melinoe speaks to Charon even when he is not present in the current room.
<!--Releasenotes end-->

## v1.4.1

- You are no longer forced to immediately tip after the intro conversation at the tip jar - prevents accidentally tipping all Gold before shopping if the exclamation mark is a distracting presence.

## v1.4.0

- Added a conversation with Charon/a note when first encountering the tip jar.
- Fixed Charon not always responding to tips in rooms where he is present.

## v1.3.0

- Added a tip jar to pre-boss shop rooms just before the final boss of Chaos trials, no matter the region it takes place in (Chaos above and below trials will still only have a tip jar in the final shop).
- Fixed the tip jar no longer appearing in Tartarus after reaching the true ending.
- Fixed the tip jar overlapping with a certain reward in the Tartarus pre-boss shop room, if it is present.

## v1.2.1

- Removed voicelines that incorrectly play when approaching the tip jar.

## v1.2.0

- Fixed the tip jar not being visible after the 1.0 update.
- Added an additional flavour text when tipping Charon.
- Added German localization.
- Updated dependencies.

## v1.1.0

- Moved the tipjar on Olympus to the shop room in the new, final biome on the overworld route, as added in the Warsong update.

## v1.0.1

- Clarified mod description.

## v1.0.0

- Initial release. Adds a tip jar to the final shop room in a run, allowing you to tip all unspent Gold to Charon, which counts towards Obol point progression.
