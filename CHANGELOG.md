# Changelog

## v1.3.0

<!--Releasenotes start-->
- Added a tip jar to pre-boss shop rooms just before the final boss of Chaos trials, no matter the region it takes place in (Chaos above and below trials will still only have a tip jar in the final shop).
- Fixed the tip jar no longer appearing in Tartarus after reaching the true ending.
- Fixed the tip jar overlapping with a certain reward in the Tartarus pre-boss shop room, if it is present.
