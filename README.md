# Charon's Tip Jar

This mod allows you to tip any unspent Gold to Charon in the shop before the final boss of a run (in Tartarus and - at the moment - Olympus).
A "tip jar" will appear next to Charon, interacting with it will tip all Gold in your possession to Charon.

Tipped Gold will count towards Obol point (reward cards) progress with Charon.
