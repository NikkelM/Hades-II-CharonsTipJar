# Charon's Tip Jar

This mod allows you to tip any unspent Gold to Charon in the shop before the final boss of a run (in Tartarus and on the Summit).
A "tip jar" will appear next to Charon, and interacting with it will tip all Gold in your possession to Charon.

When participating in a Chaos trial, a tip jar will be conveniently placed in the shop room just before the final boss of the trial as well, no matter the region it takes place in.

Tipped Gold will count towards Obol point (reward cards) progress with Charon.
